## Features

- **Fits the vanilla interface.** The journal is added as a native game-menu tab and follows Graveyard Keeper's visual style instead of drawing a separate HUD or overlay.
- **Organized by character.** Tasks are grouped under the character who gave them, while every task remains a separate selectable entry.
- **Three collapsible sections:**
  - **Favorites** — tasks you want to keep close at hand.
  - **All tasks** — every currently active task, grouped by character.
  - **Completed tasks** — finished tasks read directly from the game state.
- **Useful details for every task and character:**
  - character name and portrait;
  - full task objective;
  - whether the character is currently present on the map;
  - character location;
  - appearance schedule and day icon, when applicable;
  - base-game or DLC origin.
- **Favorites.** Mark any active task as a favorite and return to it immediately. Favorites preserve their insertion order and are stored in the mod configuration, independently from game saves.
- **Character navigation.** Enable navigation for a task to receive an on-screen direction marker. The mod points directly to a reachable character or chooses the appropriate shortest route through entrances and transitions when the character is in another location.
- **Route updates.** Navigation refreshes after dialogue, scene transitions, teleports, and meaningful player movement.
- **Completed-task history.** Review tasks the game already marks as completed without modifying the save file.
- **Save-safe design.** The mod only reads quest data from the game; it does not create an alternative quest system or write custom data into saves.
- **Quick access.** Press `F6` while playing to open the journal tab.

## Languages

**The journal interface supports every language available in Graveyard Keeper.** It automatically follows the language selected in the game settings.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Graveyard Keeper
- BepInEx 5.4.23.5

### Installing BepInEx

1. Open the [Graveyard Keeper BepInEx 5 Pack on Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/graveyardkeeper/mods/79?tab=files).
2. Download **BepInEx - Windows-Wine-Proton - 64-bit** from the **Files** tab.
3. Extract the downloaded archive directly into the main Graveyard Keeper folder, next to `Graveyard Keeper.exe`.
4. Start the game once, then close it. BepInEx will create its folders and configuration files.

After a successful installation, the game folder will contain `BepInEx`, `doorstop_config.ini`, and `winhttp.dll`.

### Installing Vanilla Quest Journal

2. Copy the included `VanillaQuestJournal` folder into:

   ```text

   ```

3. Start the game. The new **Quests** tab will appear in the regular game menu.

The resulting layout should be:

```text
Graveyard Keeper/
└── BepInEx/
    └── plugins/
        └── VanillaQuestJournal/
            ├── VanillaQuestJournal.dll
            └── languages/
